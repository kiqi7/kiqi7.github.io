| **Multi-Modal** | Align language model outputs with human preferences. | Efficiently fine-tune large language models with reduced memory usage. |
| **NLP** | Uses a new parameterization of the reward model in RLHF to extract the optimal policy directly using classification loss. | Combines 4-bit quantization of a pretrained model with Low Rank Adapters (LoRA). | 
| **CV** | Simplifies and stabilizes the RLHF process, eliminating the need for complex reinforcement learning procedures. | Introduces 4-bit NormalFloat quantization and Double Quantization for memory efficiency. Implements Paged Optimizers to manage memory spikes. |
