With a background in data science and applied physics, I have cultivated a deep passion for leveraging machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems and drive innovation. My journey began with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Physics from China Jiliang University, where I developed a solid foundation in mathematical principles and scientific knowledge.

Following my undergraduate studies, I pursued a Master of Science in Data Science from the University of Bath, where I gained extensive expertise in machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and applied data science.

After completing my master's degree, I embarked on a professional journey that has allowed me to further hone my skills and contribute to the advancement of machine learning technologies. As a Senior Algorithm Engineer, I developed an interactive response system based on intent recognition, applying advanced natural language processing techniques to create an efficient customer service dialogue system. Additionally, I designed an automatic data extraction and storage system that leverages large language models to process and store unstructured data.

Prior to my current role, I served as an Data Engineer, where I worked in a fast-paced environment to analyze, design, develop, and deliver Enterprise Data Warehouse solutions for various teams, including Sales, Delivery, Finance, and Insurance. I also created and maintained ETL pipelines using Python and Airflow, supporting BI platform with cutting-edge BI tools.

<!-- I processed raw data from scratch, including data acquisition and modeling. I built data pipelines using Kettle and Python, and leveraged SQL and Python to process and analyze large datasets. One of my notable projects involved developing a product profile and sentiment analysis system, which involved designing and optimizing end-to-end multi-classification and multi-task models using NLP machine learning algorithms.

Beyond my technical pursuits, I am a trilingual speaker, fluent in Mandarin (my native language), Japanese, and English. I actively engage in voluntary work, including leadership activities, and I am an experienced SLR landscape photographer with a keen eye for detail and a passion for capturing the beauty of the world around me. Additionally, I enjoy staying active through gym activities and indulging my creative side by singing and playing the guitar. -->

With a diverse skill set, a thirst for knowledge, and a commitment to excellence, I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to push the boundaries of what's possible in the field of machine learning. I believe in the power of collaboration and welcome the chance to work alongside like-minded individuals who share my passion for innovation and problem-solving.
